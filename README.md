# File Management Server with Private Protocol

## Phase I

In this phase, the Internet connection between the server and client is realized. Start the server and client by typing `./ftpserver ../conf/server.conf` and `./client [ip] [port]` on bash respectively.

In Phase I, the client provides more than six clauses similar to bash commands. The fundamental commands are listed as below:

1. `cd` - change directory
2. `ls` - list files and directories
3. `puts` - upload local files to the server
4. `gets` - download files from server to client
5. `remove` - delete files on the server
6. `pwd` - print working directory
7. other commands such as `mkdir` and etc.

In this phase, clauses 1 to 6 will be correctly responded. User types a clause on client and presses enter to send it to the server. The command should be pretreated and checked before being sent to the server. Server executes commands after receiving. The result of command execution will be sent to the client and output to the user.
